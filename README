Win32/ANSIConsole version 0.01
==============================

Windows NT/2000/XP does not support ANSI escape sequences in
Win32 Console applications.
This module emulate an ANSI console for the script which uses it.
Only the escape codes of the ansi.sys driver has been implemented.

This module can convert the characters from the code page cp1250
to the code page cp850 (the so-called ANSI to OEM conversion).
The conversion is not perfect but permits the display of the
accented characters in the console like in a Windows-based editor.
(others mapping between codepages on request...)

It works on all Win32 platforms.

Caution: this module is still in beta stage; don't use it in a
production script.

All suggestion or remark is welcome.
